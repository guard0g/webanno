## Monitoring ##

As an administrator, you are able to observe the progress and document status of projects you are responsible for. Moreover, you are able to see the time of the last login of every user and observe the agreement between the annotators.
After clicking on “Monitoring” in Home, the following page is displayed:

In the right frame, the overall progress of all projects is displayed.
In the left frame one sees all projects, that one has an adminster role in.
By clicking on one of the projects on the left, it may be selected and the following view is opened:

The percentual progress out of the worload for individual annotators may be viewed as well as the number of finished documents.

The following table will explain the different symbols, which explain the status of a document for a user and the described task.

| **Symbol** | **Meaning** |
|:-----------|:------------|
| <img src='https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/new_symbol.png' width='20' /> | Document not opened by user |
|<img src='https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/lock_symbol.png' width='20' />| Document not available to user |
|<img src='https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/leiste_symbol.png' width='20' />| Curation of document in progress |
|<img src='https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/done_button.png' width='20' /> | Document finished |
| <img src='https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/triangle_symbol.png' width='20' />| Document in progress |



You can also alter the document status of annotators. By clicking on the symbols you can change between “Done” and “In Progress”.
You can also alter between “New” and “Blocked” status.
The second column of the Document status frame displays the status of the curation.

As there is only one curator for one document, curation is not divided into individual curators.


Scrolling down, two further frames become visible. The left one, named “Layer”, allows you to chose a layer in which pairwise kappa agreement between annotators will be calculated.
