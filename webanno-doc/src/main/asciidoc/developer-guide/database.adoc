[[sect_database]]
== Database Model

=== Projects

`project`

=== Documents

==== `source_document`

The original document uploaded by a user into a project. The document is preserved in its original
format.

==== `annotation_document`

Annotations made by a particular user on a document. The annotation document is persisted separately
from the original document. There is one annotation document per user per document. Within the tool,
a CAS data structure is used to represent the annotation document.


=== Layers

NOTE: For historical reasons, the names in the database differ: `attachType` is called 
      `annotation_type`, `attachFeature` is called `annotation_feature`.

===== Span layer

A span layer allows to create annotations over spans of text.

If `attachType` is set, then an annotation can only be created over the same span on which an annotation of the specified type also exists. For span layers, setting `attachFeature` is mandatory
if a `attachType` is defined. The `attachFeature` indicates the feature on the annotation of the `attachType` layer which is to be set to the newly created annotation. 

For example, the `Lemma` layer has the `attachType` set to `Token` and the `attachFeature` set to `lemma`. This means, that a new lemma annotation can only be created where a token already exists
and that the `lemma` feature of the token will point to the newly created lemma annotation.

Deleting an annotation that has other annotations attached to it will also cause the attached annotations to be deleted.

===== Relation layer

A relation layer allows to draw arcs between span annotations. The `attachType` is mandatory for relation types and specifies which type of annotations arcs can be drawn between. 

Arcs can only be drawn between annotations of the same layer. It is not possible to draw an arc between two spans of different layers. 

Only a single relation layer can attach to any given span layer.

If the `annotation_feature` is set, then the arc is not drawn between annotations of the layer indicated by `annotation_type`, but between annotations of the type specified by the feature. E.g. for a dependency relation layer, `annotation_type` would be set to `Token` and `annotation_feature`
to `pos`. The `Token` type has no visual representation in the UI. However, the `pos` feature points to a `POS` annotation, which is rendered and between which the dependency relation arcs are then drawn. 

Deleting an annotation that is the endpoint of a relation will also delete the relation. In the case
that `annotation_feature`, this is also the case if the annotation pointed to is deleted. E.g. if
a POS annotation in the above example is deleted, then the attaching relation annotations are also
deleted.

===== Chain layer

| enabled
| If the feature can be used for annotation or not. Features cannot be deleted after creation 
because we need to retain the type definitions in order to load CASes which still contains the type,
so this is a way to not allow editing/displaying of these types anymore.

| visible
| Feature rendered - if set to false only shown in annotation editor

| tag_set
| *optional* The id of the tagset which is used for this layer. If this is null, the label can be freely set
(text input field), otherwise only values from the tagset can be used as labels.
