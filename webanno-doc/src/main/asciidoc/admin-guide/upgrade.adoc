== Upgrade

=== Exporting/importing

* Log into WebAnno and export all the projects that you wish to migrate using the *Export* pane in the project settings
* Move your WebAnno home folder to a safe location so that WebAnno and create a new home folder in the old location
* Copy the *settings.properties* and *formats.properties* (if present) back from your moved folder
* Start the new WebAnno version to initialize the database
* Recreate the users
** If you are using MySQL
*** create a new database for the new WebAnno version and update the *settings.properties* accordingly
*** use link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html[mysqldump] to dump the tables `users` and `authorities` from the old database and load it back into the new database
** If you are not using MySQL, you have to recreate the users manually
* When upgrading to WebAnno 2.x from a pre 2.x version, remove the *format.properties* file from the WebAnno home folder
* Restart WebAnno and import the previously exported projects

=== In-place update

This method should work when updating only a bugfix version, e.g. from 2.0.9 to 2.0.10. When performing a minor or major update, better use the exporting/importing method above.  

* *Make a backup of your data before upgrading to a new version:*
** Make a copy of your WebAnno home folder
** If you are using MySQL, make a backup of your WebAnno database, e.g. using the link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html[mysqldump] command.
* Standalone version
** clean up the temporary installation before running the new version:
*** On OS X: `rm -R "$TMPDIR/winstoneEmbeddedWAR"`
*** On Linux: `rm -R /tmp/winstoneEmbeddedWAR`
*** On Windows: remove the `winstoneEmbeddedWAR` that should be somewhere under `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`
** start the new version
* WAR version
** while Tomcat is running, delete the old WAR from your `webapps` folder
** wait until Tomcat has automatically deleted the WebAnno folder 
** stop Tomcat
** place the new WAR file into your `webapps` folder
** start Tomcat
