[[sect_installation]]
== Installation

All-in-one version which does not require a database server or servlet container to be set up.

Get the standalone jar from the [WebAnnoInstFile downloads] and start it simply with a *double-click* in your file manager. !WebAnno stores its data in a folder called `.webanno` (_dot webanno_) within your home folder,

You can start with the [SampleProjects example projects] to explore some of the functionalities. 

[NOTE]
====
If you have previously used an older version of the WebAnno standalone, make sure to clean up the temporary installation before running the new version:

   * On OS X: `rm -R "$TMPDIR/winstoneEmbeddedWAR"`
   * On Linux: `rm -R /tmp/winstoneEmbeddedWAR`
   * On Windows: remove the `winstoneEmbeddedWAR` that should be somewhere under `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`
====

=== Optional configuration

Alternatively, you can start WebAnno from the command line, in particular if you wish to provide it with additional memory (here 1 GB) or if you want it to store its data in a different folder.

----
java -Xmx1g -Dwebanno.home=/my/webanno/home -jar webanno-XXX-standalone.jar
----

Mind to replace `/my/webanno/home` with path of a folder where WebAnno can store its data.

By default the server starts on port 8080 an you can access it via a browser at `http://localhost:8080` after you started it. You can add the parameter `--httpPort=9999` at the end of the command line to start the server on port 9999 (or choose any other port).

A full list of the command line parameters can be found in the link:http://winstone.sourceforge.net/#commandLine[Winstone documentation].
