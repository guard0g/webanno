== Monitoring ==

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *project managers* (managers of existing projects), 
      *curators*, and *administrators*. Curators and project managers only see projects in which
      they hold the respective roles.

As an administrator, you are able to observe the progress and document status of projects you are 
responsible for. Moreover, you are able to see the time of the last login of every user and observe the agreement between the annotators.
After clicking on *Monitoring* in the main menu, the following page is displayed:

In the right frame, the overall progress of all projects is displayed.
on the left frame one sees all projects, that one has an administrator role in.  
By clicking on one of the projects on the left, it may be selected and the following view is opened:

The percentual progress out of the workload for individual annotators may be viewed as well as the number of finished documents.

The following table will explain the different symbols, which explain the status of a document for a user and the described task.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
| Symbol
| Meaning

| image:icon_new.png[align="center"]
| Annotation has not started yet

| image:icon_locked.png[align="center"]
| Document not available to user

| image:icon_annotation_in_progress.png[align="center"]
| Annotation is in progress

| image:icon_done.png[align="center"]
| Annotation is complete

| image:icon_curation_in_progress.png[align="center"]
| Curation is in progress
|===

You can also alter the document status of annotators. By clicking on the symbols you can change between *Done* and *In Progress*.
You can also alter between *New* and *Locked* status. 
The second column of the document status frame displays the status of the curation. 

As there is only one curator for one document, curation is not divided into individual curators.

Scrolling down, two further frames become visible. The left one, named *Layer*, allows you to chose a layer in which pairwise kappa agreement between annotators will be calculated.

=== Agreement ===

Agreement can be inspected on a per-feature basis and it is calculates pair-wise between all 
annotators across all document. Agreement is calculated using Cohen's kappa as implemented in
DKPro Statistics.

The first time a feature is selected for agreement inspection, it takes a moment to calculate the
differences between the annotated documents. Switching between different features subsequently
is much faster.

Agreement is calculated in two steps:

. *Generation of positions and configuration sets* - all documents are scanned for annotations and 
   annotations located at the same positions are collected in configuration sets. To determine if
   two annotations are at the same position, different approaches are used depending on the layer
   type. For a span layer, the begin and end offsets are used. For a relation layer, the begin/end
   offsets of the source and target annotation are used. Chains are currently not supported. 
. *Calculation of pairwise agreement* - based on the generated configuration sets, agreement is calculated.
  There are two cases where a configuration set may be omitted from the pairwise agreement calculation:
.. one of the users did not make an annotation at the position;
.. one or both of the users did not assign a value to the feature on which agreement is calculated
   at the position.

The lower part of the agreement matrix displays how many configuration sets were used to calculate
agreement and how many were found in total. The upper part of the agreement matrix displays the
pairwise Cohen's kappa scores.
