== Monitoring ==

As an administrator, you are able to observe the progress and document status of projects you are 
responsible for. Moreover, you are able to see the time of the last login of every user and observe the agreement between the annotators.
After clicking on *Monitoring* in the main menu, the following page is displayed:

In the right frame, the overall progress of all projects is displayed.
on the left frame one sees all projects, that one has an administrator role in.  
By clicking on one of the projects on the left, it may be selected and the following view is opened:

The percentual progress out of the workload for individual annotators may be viewed as well as the number of finished documents.

The following table will explain the different symbols, which explain the status of a document for a user and the described task.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
| Symbol
| Meaning

| image:icon_new.png[align="center"]
| Annotation has not started yet

| image:icon_locked.png[align="center"]
| Document not available to user

| image:icon_annotation_in_progress.png[align="center"]
| Annotation is in progress

| image:icon_done.png[align="center"]
| Annotation is complete

| image:icon_curation_in_progress.png[align="center"]
| Curation is in progress
|===

You can also alter the document status of annotators. By clicking on the symbols you can change between *Done* and *In Progress*.
You can also alter between *New* and *Locked* status. 
The second column of the document status frame displays the status of the curation. 

As there is only one curator for one document, curation is not divided into individual curators.

Scrolling down, two further frames become visible. The left one, named *Layer*, allows you to chose a layer in which pairwise kappa agreement between annotators will be calculated.
