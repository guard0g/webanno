== Upgrade

This section describes how to upgrade the standalone version of WebAnno using an embedded database. For further information on how to upgrade WebAnno, in particular the WAR version, when using a MySQL database, or older versions of WebAnno, please refer to the <<admin-guide.adoc#,Administrator Guide>>.

=== Make a backup

Before any upgrade, make a copy of your WebAnno home folder.

IMPORTANT: If WebAnno is configured to use an external database, e.g. MySQL, make a backup of this
         database as well. See the <<admin-guide.adoc#,Administrator Guide>> for further information.

=== Upgrade from 2.0.x to 2.1.x

* clean up the temporary installation before running the new version:
** On OS X: `rm -R "$TMPDIR/winstoneEmbeddedWAR"`
** On Linux: `rm -R /tmp/winstoneEmbeddedWAR`
** On Windows: remove the `winstoneEmbeddedWAR` that should be somewhere under `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`
* start the new version
