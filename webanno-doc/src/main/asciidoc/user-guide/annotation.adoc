== Annotation

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *annotators*, *project managers*, and 
      *administrators*. Annotators and project managers only see projects in which
      they hold the respective roles. 

=== Opening a Document

When navigating to the *Annotation* page, a dialogue opens that allows you to select a project, and 
a document within the project. If you want to open a different project or document later, click on 
*Open* button to open the dialog.

image::annotation1.jpg[align="center"]

Projects appear as folders, and contain the documents of the project. Double-click on a document to 
open it for annotation. Document names written in black show that the document has not been opened 
by the current user, blue font means that it has already been opened, whereas red font indicates 
that the document has already been marked as *done*.

Once the document is opened, a default of 10 sentences are loaded on the annotation  page.  The  
*Settings*  button will  allow  you  to specify the settings of you the annotation layer.

The first option allows you to select an Annotation Layer you are displayed during annotation. The second option allows you to specify the number of sentences that will be displayed on one page. The last option allows you to select auto-scroll while annotating. Auto-scroll scrolls automatically forward by putting the last annotated sentence in the middle.

=== Navigation

Sentence  numbers  on  the  left  side  of  the  annotation  page  shows  the  exact sentence numbers in the document. 

image::annotation3.jpg[align="center"]

The arrow buttons *first page*, *next page*, *previous page*, *last page*, and *go to page* allow you to navigate accordingly. The *Prev.* and *Next* buttons in the *Document* frame allow you to go to the previous or next document on your project list. You can also use the following keyboard assignments in order to navigate only using your keyboard.

.Navigation key bindings
|====
| Key | Action |

| *HOME*
| jump to first sentence

| *END*
| jump to last sentence

| *PAGE DOWN*
| move to the next page, if not in the last page already

| *PAGE UP*
| move to previous page, if not already in the first page

| *SHIFT+PAGE DOWN*
| go to next document in project, if available

| *SHIFT+PAGE UP* 
| go to previous document in project, if available
|====

A click on the *Help* button displays the Guidelines for the tool and *The Annotator's Guide to NER-Annotation*.
When you are finished with annotating or curating a document, please click on the *Done*
button, so that the document may be further processed. If the button above the *Done* is a cross symbol, it means the documents has already been finished. If the symbol has a tick, it is still open.

Annotation of spans works by selecting the span, or double-clicking on a word. This opens the annotation dialog, where you can add a new annotation. The layer can be selected on the left side of the frame. The tag can be selected out of the right box, containing the tags of the tagset. One can also type in the initial letters and chose the needed tag. In the case of lemma annotation, a lemma can be typed into the box on the right. 

image::annotation_edit.jpg[align="center"]

To change or delete an annotation, double-click on the annotation (span or link annotations).

Link annotations (between POS tags) are created by selecting the starting POS-tag, then dragging the arrow to connect it to its target POS tag. All possible targets are highlighted.

=== Export

Annotations are always immediately persistent in the backend database. Thus, it is not necessary to  save the annotations explicitly. Also, losing the connection through network issues or timeouts does not cause data loss. To obtain a local copy of the current document, click on *export* button. The following frame will appear:

image::annotation_export.jpg[align="center"]

Choose your preferred format. Please take note of the facts that the plain text format does not contain any annotations and that the files in the binary format need to be unpacked before further usage. For further information on the formats provided in WebAnno, please consult the corresponding chapter [OutputFormat WebAnno's supported formats].

The document will be saved to your local disk, and can be re-imported via adding the document to a project by a project administrator. Please export your data periodically, at least when finishing a document or not continuing annotations for an extended period of time. 


=== Making annotations

To create annotations in WebAnno, you have mainly two options:

* select a span of text to create a span annotation
* click on an existing span annotation and drag an arc to another span annotation

The definition of layers is covered in section <<sect_projects_layers>>.

==== Spans

To create an annotation over a span of text, click with the mouse on the text and drag the mouse to
create a selection. When you release the mouse, the annotation detail editor is updated to display
the text you have currently selected and to offer a choice on which layer the annotation is to be
created. The annotation is finally created when you press the *Create* button.

To avoid accidental creations of zero-length annotations, a simple single-click triggers no action
by default. To create a zero-length annotation, hold *SHIFT* and click on the position where you
wish to create the annotation.

To abort the creation of an annotation, hold *CTRL* when you release the mouse button.

Depending on the layer behavior configuration, spans annotations can have any length, can overlap,
can stack, can nest, and can cross sentence boundaries. 

For example, for NE annotation, select the options as shown below (red check mark):

image::annotation2.jpg[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition[NE] annotation can be chosen from a tagset and can span over several tokens within one sentence. Nested NE annotations are also possible (in the example below: "Frankfurter" in "Frankfurter FC"). 

image::annotation_ner.jpg[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_%28morphology%29[Lemma] annotation, as shown below, is freely selectable over a single token.

image::annotation_lemma.jpg[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech[POS] can be chosen over one token out of a tagset.

image::annotation_pos.jpg[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference[Co-reference] annotation can be made over several tokens within one sentence. A single token sequence have several co-ref spans simultaneously.

==== Relations

To create a relation annotation, click on a span annotation and drag the mouse to another span
annotation. While you drag, an arc is drawn. It is not possible to create arbitrary relation 
annotations. In order to create one, a corresponding relation layer needs to be defined between
the source and target spans.

To abort the creation of an annotation, hold *CTRL* when you release the mouse button.

Depending on the layer behavior configuration, relation annotations can stack, can cross each other,
cross sentence boundaries. 

NOTE: Currently, there can be at most one relation layer per span layer and relation between spans
      of different layers are not supported.

NOTE: A special behavior for the built-in *Dependency* layer is the handling of the dependency 
      root. To mark a token as the *ROOT* of the dependency tree, create a dependency relation from
      the POS tag a to itself (a circle). This behavior is not active for custom relation layers!

NOTE: Not all arcs displayed in the annotation view are belonging to chain or relation layers. Some
      are induced by <<sect_annotation_link_features>>.

image::annotation_span_many.jpg[align="center"]

==== Chains

A chain layer includes both, span and relation annotations into a single structural layer. Creating
a span annotation in a chain layer basically creates a chain of length one. Creating a relation 
between two chain elements has different effects depending on whether the *linked list* behavior
is enabled for the chain layer or not.

To abort the creation of an annotation, hold *CTRL* when you release the mouse button.

.Chain behavior
|====
| Linked List | Condition | Result

| disabled
| the two spans are already in the same chain
| nothing happens

| disabled
| the two spans are in different chains
| the two chains are merged FIXME

| enabled
| the two spans are already in the same chains
| the chain will be re-linked such that a chain link points from the source to the target span, 
  potentially creating new chains in the process.

| enabled
| the two spans are in different chains
| the chains will be re-linked such that a chain link points from the source to the target span, 
  merging the two chains and potentially creating new chains from the remaining prefix and suffix
  of the original chains.

==== Primitive features

WebAnno supports primitive features that can be of the type string, boolean, integer, and float.
Boolean features are displayed as a checkbox that can either be marked or unmarked. Integer and 
float features are displayed using a number field. String features are displayed using a text field
or - in case they have a tagset - using a combobox.

[[sect_annotation_link_features]]
==== Link features

Link features can be used to link one annotation to others. Before a link can be made, a slot with 
a role must be added. Enter the role label in the text field and press the *add* button to create
the slot. Next, click on field in the newly created slot to *arm* it. The field's color will change
to indicate that it is armed. Now you can fill the slot by double-clicking on a span 
annotation. To remove a slot, arm it and then press the *del* button.
