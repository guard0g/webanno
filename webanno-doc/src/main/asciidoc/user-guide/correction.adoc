[[sect_correction]]
== Correction

In this page, already annotated documents may be checked, corrected and enhanced.

Before being able to see and correct documents, make sure to have chosen _correction_ when creating your project in projects. The instruction to do so is on the following page: <<sect_projects>>. Also make sure that the documents you upload are already annotated.

After clicking on the *Correction* symbol on the main page, the Correction page is opened. In the appearing frame, which is the left one in the image below, the user has to choose a project first.

Afterwards the documents assigned to him are displayed. Now he may choose a document. Just like in <<sect_annotation>> and <<sect_curation>>, the colour of the document names signals the following: black- unopened document, blue- opened document and red - document finished. 

After having chosen the document, two frames are displayed.

The upper one, Annotation, is the frame in which annotations can be made by the user. Moreover, it displays the chosen annotations.
The lower frame, User: Suggestion, displays the annotation that was previously made in the uploaded document. By clicking on the annotations (not the words), they are chosen as _right_ and are therefore displayed in the Annotation frame. Additional annotations may be made just like in _Annotation_, by selecting the span or relation to be annotated, choosing the layer and tag. For more detailed instruction or the guidelines for the navigation in the upper frames (Document, Page, Help, Workflow), see the guidelines for <<sect_annotation>>. 
No changes may be made in the lower frame.

The colouring of the annotation signals the same as in <<sect_curation>>.
